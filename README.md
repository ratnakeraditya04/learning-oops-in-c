# OOPS Practice and Examples Repository 

I sincerely want to thank Codehelp - Love Babbar for helping me understand OOPs concepts in C++ language. This repository contains all code that I made while learning OOPs from videos of him available publically on Youtube. 

I learnt about 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming Paradigm - 
1. - Encapsulation 
2. - Inheritance
3. - Polymorphism 
4. - Abstraction 


There are still some tasks left to do like learning about const keywords and const functions, difference between encapsulation and abstraction. 

Hope, with the help of his course I would be able to answer all major and important questions asked in the future interviews of many major companies. 

# Open for Collaboration
I would like to invite many fellow programmers to add certain examples of OOPs Programming in C++ and try their hands on describing situations through OOPs concepts. Do draft a push and merge requests. I would love to add in my repository.
